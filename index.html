                The exterior design had been specifically researched...after
                studying the 360-degree visibility inside an F-16 fighter jet's
                cockpit. Thematically, the F-16 came into play in the exterior
                design as well as establishing the conceptual goals of the NSX.
                In the F-16 and other high performance aircraft such as
                unlimited hydroplanes along with open-wheel race cars, the
                cockpit is located far forward and in front of the power plant.
